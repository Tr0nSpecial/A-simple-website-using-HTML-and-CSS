# A-simple-website-using-HTML-and-CSS
This is a simple website of my school Delhi Public Dhanbad. In this I attempt to cover all the properties of HTML and CSS. I already knew basics of Frontend development before the start of this project. This project helped my recall the use of many HTML and CSS properties.

The website consists of the following sections:
1.DPS(Cover Page)
2.Home
3.Courses
4.Activities
5.Faculties
6.Marks
7.Feedback
